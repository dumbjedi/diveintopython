{"name":"Diveintopython","tagline":"Learning Python","body":"### Setting Up Python.\r\nThe first step in Python's installation is running a configure script which snoops around your system, looking for packages that it needs to build various capabilities and extensions with. Having these packages installed before running configure makes sure it finds them.\r\n\r\nHere are some packages that have to be installed to have various aspects of Python functioning:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev\r\n$ sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev\r\n$ sudo apt-get install libbz2-dev\r\n$ sudo apt-get install libssl-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nGo to http://www.python.org/. In the \"Quick links\" section on the left-hand side of the page, \"Source distribution\" is a direct link to the tarball. Download it. Unzip the tarball, and from the root of the created directory (which will be called Python-2.7.2 or something similar, depending on the version):\r\n\r\n```\r\n./configure\r\nmake -j\r\n```\r\n\r\nI found that the default configure settings work fine for Ubuntu 10.04 and there's no real need to specify extra --with flags.\r\n\r\nYou can now check that Python was correctly built by executing ./python and falling into its interactive terminal. If you want, you can also execute the Python test-suite with make test, though it may take a long time to run (~10 minutes on a relatively fast machine).\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo make install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis installs Python into /usr/local/bin. Depending on the configuration of your system, you may want to add symlinks to the newly created /usr/local/bin/python2.7 in /usr/bin/ as well.\r\n\r\nThat's it, you now have Python 2.7 installed.\r\n\r\nPython has a powerful packaging & installation machinery for its modules, but it doesn't come pre-installed with Python itself.\r\n\r\nSo it's a good idea to install setuptools (or distribute), followed by pip.\r\n\r\nFrom now, pip can be used to install other Python modules very conveniently. For example, all you need to have the IPython shell installed is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsudo pip install ipython\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
